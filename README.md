# My React implementation of the classic learner's project, a to-do list.

## Description
I made the first iteration of this for my Odin Project studies. When the time came to learn React, coming back to refactor this seemed like a logical step.
    
And I was right! Writing this with React vs vanilla was a joy - I felt like I just discovered a new superpower.
